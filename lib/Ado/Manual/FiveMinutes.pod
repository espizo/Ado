Ado::Manual::FiveMinutes - Start a personal blog in five minutes.

=head1 FIVE MINUTES

Create a directory for L<Ado> and install it in it.

  mkdir ~/ado 
  curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - -M https://cpan.metacpan.org -l ~/ado -n Ado

Start Ado.

  ~/ado/bin/ado daemon

You should see: 

  Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000

Create a file that will contain your first article.
Or edit one of the already existing sample files there.

  touch ~/ado/public/articles/my_article.md
  vim ~/ado/public/articles/hello.md

Eventually add a link to the newly created file (but with .html extension) to
the menu containing links to the articles which are "published". Copy the menu
template so it is not overwritten when you upgrade Ado.


  mkdir -p ~/ado/site_templates/articles
  cp ~/ado/templates/articles/menu.html.ep ~/ado/site_templates/articles/

  #edit ~/ado/site_templates/articles/menu.html.ep

  <a href="/articles/hello.html" class="item">История</a>
  <a href="/articles/ala/bala.html" class="item">FooBar</a>
  <a href="/articles/my_article.html" class="item">My Article</a>

Go to L<http://127.0.0.1:3000/articles/my_article.html>. Nice!

Enable caching of articles. The generated HTML will be stored as plain static
files which will be served automatically.

  touch ~/ado/etc/plugins/markdown_renderer.development.conf

Add the following code to C<markdown_renderer.development.conf>:

  {   
      #Do not convert files to HTML on every request
      #but reuse already produced html files.
      md_reuse_produced_html => 1,
  };

Refresh L<http://127.0.0.1:3000/articles/my_article.html>. In C<~/ado/public/articles> You will find C<my_article.html>.
Congratulations! You created your first article with L<Ado> without much ado.

Now you can fork the project on L<Github|https://github.com/kberov/Ado>,
improve C<menu.html.ep> to automatically traverse the articles directory and
generate the list of articles  and make a merge request.
